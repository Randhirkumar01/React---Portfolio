        👋 Hi, I’m Randhir Kumar — A Front-end Web Developer and Computer
        Science Final year student with hands-on experience in building
        responsive web applications using React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.
        Skilled in API integration, modern UI design, and interactive
        animations, with practical training in web programming and frontend
        development. A passionate web developer who loves crafting clean,
        efficient code and turning ideas into interactive experiences.
        <br /> <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a foundation in front-end
        technologies, I’ve built 8+ real-world projects using tools like HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript, and React. I thrive on solving problems and
        continuously learning — whether it’s integrating APIs, debugging tough
        issues, or designing user-focused interfaces. <br />
        <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I enjoy collaborating with other
        developers and designers, and I believe in writing code that’s readable,
        reusable, and reliable. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me
        exploring open-source projects or leveling up on new tech trends. I
        thrive on challenges and enjoy transforming ideas into functional and
        engaging digital experiences.
