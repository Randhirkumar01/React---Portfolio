        ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Randhir â€” a passionate web developer who loves crafting
        clean, efficient code and turning ideas into interactive experiences.
        <br /> <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a foundation in both
        front-end and back-end technologies, Iâ€™ve built [insert number]
        real-world projects using tools like React, Node.js, and Express. I
        thrive on solving problems and continuously learning â€” whether itâ€™s
        integrating APIs, debugging tough issues, or designing user-focused
        interfaces. <br />
        <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I enjoy collaborating with other
        developers and designers, and I believe in writing code thatâ€™s readable,
        reusable, and reliable. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me
        exploring open-source projects or leveling up on new tech trends. I
        thrive on challenges and enjoy transforming ideas into functional and
        engaging digital experiences.
